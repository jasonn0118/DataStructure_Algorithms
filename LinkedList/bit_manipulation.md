# Bit Manipulation
## When to use it?
1. Count number of 0 or 1 bits in a number
2. Add numbers without using addition or subtraction
3. Find a missing number in a list

## Technique
For bit manipulation, ensure you understand the basic bitwise operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `XOR` and bitwise shifts. Specifically, `XOR` has interesting properties that allow you to find a missing number in a list or add up 2 numbers without using the addition or subtraction operation. You want to be comfortable with some of the basic bitwise operators, but don't go too in depth here as these questions can be quite rare.
