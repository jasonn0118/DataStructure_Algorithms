# BFS vs DFS
## Use BFS When:
### ‚úÖ Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph
- BFS explores all neighbours first before moving deeper, ensuring that the first time it reaches a node is through the shortest path.
- Example: Finding the shortest path in a maze.
### ‚úÖ Searching in a tree level by level
- BFS is ideal when working with ****hierarchical structures**** like trees and needing to process nodes level-wise.
### ‚úÖ When the solution is likely to be close to the starting node
- BFS quickly finds solutions near the root.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
- **O(V + E)**: Where V = vertices, E = edges

### üì¶ Space Complexity:
- **O(V)**: Stores all nodes in the queue

## Use DFS When:
### ‚úÖ Exploring all possible path or deep structures
- DFS is great for problems that require **checking all paths** before backtracking.
- Example: Finding all possible paths in a maze
### ‚úÖ When the solution is likely to be far from the starting node
- DFS goes deep first, so it might reach deeper solutions faster.
### ‚úÖ Solving connectivity problems
- DFS helps in checking whether a graph is connected.
- Example: Detecting cycles in a graph.
### ‚úÖ Working with recursion-based problems(Backtracking)
- DFS is useful for problems that require **backtracking**, such as:
    - Solving a Sudoku
    - Generating all possible permutations

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
- **O(V + E)**: Same as BFS

### üì¶ Space Complexity:
- **O(V)**: For recursion stack or explicit stack

## Summary
| Feature         | BFS                          | DFS                          |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Use Case**   | Shortest path, level-wise traversal | Exploring all paths, deep search |
| **Data Structure** | Queue (FIFO) | Stack (recursion or explicit) |
| **Time Complexity** | O(V + E) | O(V + E) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(V) (queue) | O(V) (stack) |
| **Best for**   | Shortest path, shallow solutions | Deep solutions, exhaustive search |

## DFS Traversals: Preorder, Inorder and Postorder
When performing **Depth-First Search(DFS)** on trees, there are three main ways to traverse the nodes:
1.	Preorder Traversal (Root ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right)
2.	Inorder Traversal (Left ‚Üí Root ‚Üí Right)
3.	Postorder Traversal (Left ‚Üí Right ‚Üí Root)

These traversals are particularly useful for different types of tree-based problems.

### 1. Preorder Traversal (Root ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right)
Steps:
1.	Visit the root node.
2.	Traverse the left subtree.
3.	Traverse the right subtree.

**Use Cases of Preorder Traversal**

**‚úÖ Copying a Tree** ‚Äì Since Preorder visits the root before its children, it is useful for cloning a tree.
**‚úÖ Serializing and Deserializing a Tree** ‚Äì Used in encoding a tree into a format for storage.
**‚úÖ Constructing a tree from root-first traversal** ‚Äì If you are given a root-based dataset, Preorder helps reconstruct the tree.

```javascript
function preorder(root) {
    if (!root) return;
    console.log(root.val); // Visit root
    preorder(root.left);   // Traverse left
    preorder(root.right);  // Traverse right
}
```

### 2. Inorder Traversal (Left ‚Üí Root ‚Üí Right)
Steps:
1.	Traverse the left subtree.
2.	Visit the root node.
3.	Traverse the right subtree.

**Use Cases of Inorder Traversal**

**‚úÖ Retrieving elements in sorted order (BST)** ‚Äì When used on a Binary Search Tree (BST), it retrieves nodes in ascending order.
**‚úÖ Checking if a tree is a BST** ‚Äì If the Inorder traversal of a BST is sorted, then it‚Äôs a valid BST.

```javascript
function inorder(root) {
    if (!root) return;
    inorder(root.left);    // Traverse left
    console.log(root.val); // Visit root
    inorder(root.right);   // Traverse right
}
```

### 3. Postorder Traversal (Left ‚Üí Right ‚Üí Root)
Steps:
1.	Traverse the left subtree.
2.	Traverse the right subtree.
3.	Visit the root node.

**Use Cases of Postorder Traversal**

**‚úÖ Deleting a Tree** ‚Äì Ensures that child nodes are deleted before their parent, making it useful for freeing memory.
**‚úÖ Expression Tree Evaluation** ‚Äì Used in evaluating mathematical expressions, where operands are processed before operators.

```javascript
function postorder(root) {
    if (!root) return;
    postorder(root.left);   // Traverse left
    postorder(root.right);  // Traverse right
    console.log(root.val);  // Visit root
}
```

## Short Questions
1. If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree
- BFS
2. If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare 
- BFS (DFS will take long) - although, it will take more memory
3. If the tree is very wide 
- DFS (BFS will need too much memory)
4. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
- DFS
5. Determining whether a path exists between two nodes
- DFS
6. Finding the shortest path
- BFS
