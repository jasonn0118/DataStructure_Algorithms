//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// A: Breadth First Search

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
// A: BFS(DFS will take long)

//If the tree is very wide:
// A: Depth First Search (BFS will need to much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// A: DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// A: DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
// A: BFS
